Ubuntu Dev Machine
=================

A lot has been said about dev ops, and automating the staging and production servers of applications.
But what about the developers machines?

If you get a brand new one, or format yours, there's a lot to do, lot of apps to install, software to configure.

This script aims to fill this gap. It asks a lot of questions, but then you can just leave the desk, and walk away while it does its job.

### Warning

Please don't use this  on you real installation, for now. It's on alpha stages
