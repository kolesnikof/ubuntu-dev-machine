Ubuntu Dev Machine
=================

A lot has been said about dev ops, and automating the staging and production servers of applications.
But what about the developers' machines?

If you get a brand new one, or format yours, there's a lot to do, lot of apps to install and configure.

This script aims to fill this gap. It asks a lot of questions, but then you can just leave the desk, and walk away while it does its job.

### Warning: use at your own risk

This is how you use it:

```
wget https://github.com/mauricioac/ubuntu-dev-machine/blob/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
bash ./install.sh
```
